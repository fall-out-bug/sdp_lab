## Feature Commands

### @feature

**Purpose:** Unified entry point for feature development

**Usage:**
```bash
@feature "Feature description"
```

**What it does:**
1. Interactive requirements gathering
2. Creates PRODUCT_VISION.md
3. Generates workstream plan
4. Sets up Beads task tracking

**Output:**
- `docs/drafts/idea-{slug}.md` - Requirements document
- Beads task with feature ID

**Example:**
```bash
@feature "Add user authentication"
```

**See:** [.claude/skills/feature/SKILL.md](../../.claude/skills/feature/SKILL.md)

### @design

**Purpose:** Plan workstreams from requirements

**Usage:**
```bash
@design idea-{slug}
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads requirements document
2. Decomposes into workstreams
3. Creates dependency graph
4. Generates workstream files

**Output:**
- `docs/workstreams/backlog/WS-*.md` - Workstream files
- Dependency graph visualization

---

### @deploy

**Purpose:** Deploy feature to production

**Usage:**
```bash
@deploy F{ID}

3. Merges to main branch
4. Triggers deployment pipeline

**Pre-deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] All workstreams completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Coverage ≥80%
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Example:**
```bash
@deploy F001
```

**See:** [.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md](../../.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md)

## Utility Commands

### @oneshot

**Purpose:** Autonomous feature execution

**Usage:**
```bash
@oneshot F{ID}
```

**What it does:**

2. Executes all workstreams
3. Handles dependencies
4. Save/restore checkpoints
5. Progress notifications

**Features:**
- Checkpoint save/restore
- Background execution

---

### /debug

**Purpose:** Systematic debugging

**Usage:**
```bash
/debug "Problem description"
```

**Process:**

2. Form hypothesis
3. Design experiment
4. Run experiment
5. Update hypothesis

**Example:**
```bash
/debug "Test fails unexpectedly"
