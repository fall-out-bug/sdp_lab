## Core Concepts

### SDP (Spec-Driven Protocol)

**Definition:** Workstream-driven development methodology for AI agents with multi-agent coordination.

**Context:** The overarching framework that defines how AI agents should plan, execute, and track development work through workstreams.

**Example:** "SDP v0.9.8 integrates multi-agent coordination with Beads task tracking."

**See Also:** Workstream, Feature, Release, Beads

**Related Terms:** AI-Comm, Beads CLI, Unified Orchestrator

---

### Workstream (WS)

**Definition:** Atomic task unit representing the smallest executable piece of work in SDP. Executed in one-shot fashion with clear acceptance criteria.

**Canonical Format:** `PP-FFF-SS` or `WS-PP-FFF-SS`

**Size Classifications:**
- **SMALL:** < 500 LOC, < 1500 tokens
- **MEDIUM:** 500-1500 LOC, 1500-5000 tokens
- **LARGE:** > 1500 LOC → split into 2+ WS

**Key Characteristics:**
- One-shot execution (completed in single session)
- TDD-driven (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Clear acceptance criteria
- ≤ 200 LOC per file
- ≥ 80% test coverage

**Examples:**
- `00-001-01`: First workstream of first feature
- `00-012-03`: Third workstream of feature 012 in project 00

**Legacy Names:** ~~Epic~~, ~~Sprint~~, ~~Task~~

**See Also:** Feature, Release, Acceptance Criteria, TDD

**Related Terms:** Beads Task, WS-PP-FFF-SS format

---

### Feature

**Definition:** Major deliverable composed of 5-30 workstreams. Represents a significant piece of functionality that delivers user value.

**Canonical Format:** `PP-FFF` or `F-FFF`

**Scope:** 5-30 workstreams

**Lifecycle:**
1. Requirements gathering (`@idea` or `@feature`)
2. Workstream planning (`@design`)
3. Execution (`@build` or `@oneshot`)
4. Review (`@review`)
5. Deployment (`@deploy`)

**Example:** "F24: Unified Workflow" - Feature implementing unified workflow system

**See Also:** Workstream, Release, Product Vision

**Related Terms:** Beads Task (parent), Intent, Draft

---

### Release

**Definition:** Product milestone grouping 10-30 features. Represents a significant version or delivery to production.

**Canonical Format:** `R1`, `R2`, etc.

**Scope:** 10-30 features

**Example:** "R1: Submissions E2E" - First release with end-to-end submission functionality

**See Also:** Feature, Workstream, Deployment

---

### Beads

**Definition:** Task tracking system integrated with SDP for managing hierarchical tasks and dependencies.

**Context:** Provides CLI and Python client for task management, dependency tracking, and status management.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Create hierarchical tasks (Feature → Workstreams)
- Add dependencies between tasks
- Track task status
- Query ready tasks (unblocked work)

**Examples:**
```python
client.create_task(BeadsTaskCreate(
    title="User Authentication",
    parent_id=feature.id,
))
client.add_dependency(ws2.id, ws1.id, dep_type="blocks")
ready = client.get_ready_tasks()
```

**See Also:** Workstream, Feature, Unified Orchestrator

---

## Hierarchy Levels

### Three-Level Hierarchy

**Definition:** SDP organizes work into three levels: Release → Feature → Workstream.

| Level | Scope | Size | Example |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| **Release** | Product milestone | 10-30 Features | R1: Submissions E2E |
| **Feature** | Major feature | 5-30 Workstreams | F24: Unified Workflow |
| **Workstream** | Atomic task | SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE | 00-060: Domain Model |

**Rules:**
- Workstreams belong to exactly one Feature
- Features belong to exactly one Release
- Dependencies flow only between siblings (WS→WS, Feature→Feature)

**See Also:** Workstream, Feature, Release

---

## Identifier Formats

### PP-FFF-SS Format (Canonical)

**Definition:** Standard identifier format for workstreams.

**Structure:**
- **PP** - Product/Project ID (01-99)
- **FFF** - Feature number (001-999)
- **SS** - Workstream sequence (01-99)

**Examples:**
- `01-001-01` - First workstream of first feature in project 01
- `00-012-03` - Third workstream of feature 012 in project 00

**Prefix Variants:**
- `WS-PP-FFF-SS` - Full prefix (canonical)
- `PP-FFF-SS` - Short prefix (acceptable)
- `00-001-01` - Current format (PP-FFF-SS)
- `WS-001-01` - Legacy format (deprecated)

**Validation:**
```python
# Regex pattern
r'^\d{2}-\d{3}-\d{2}$'
```

**See Also:** Workstream, Feature ID, Naming Conflicts

---

### Feature ID (PP-FFF)

**Definition:** Identifier for features.

**Structure:**
- **PP** - Product/Project ID (01-99)
- **FFF** - Feature number (001-999)

**Examples:**
- `01-001` - First feature in project 01
- `00-012` - Feature 012 in project 00

**Prefix Variants:**
- `F-FFF` - Short form (acceptable)
- `PP-FFF` - Full form (canonical)

**See Also:** Feature, Workstream ID

---

### beads-sdp-XXX Format (Legacy)

**Definition:** Legacy identifier format from early SDP versions. Still found in some documentation and file names.

**Status:** Deprecated, but may appear in:
- File names (e.g., `beads-sdp-118.md`)
- Legacy documentation
- Old Beads task titles

**Migration:** Convert to `PP-FFF-SS` format.

**Example:** `beads-sdp-118` → `01-118-XX` (multiple workstreams)

**See Also:** PP-FFF-SS Format, Naming Conflicts

---

### Idea ID

**Definition:** Identifier for requirements gathered via `@idea` command.

**Format:** `idea-{slug}` where slug is derived from the feature title.

**Examples:**
- `idea-user-auth`
- `idea-password-reset`

**Usage:**
- Input to `@design` command
- Prefix for draft files
- Temporary identifier until Feature ID assigned

**Lifecycle:** idea → Feature → Workstreams

**See Also:** Feature, @idea, @design

---

## Naming Conflicts (Resolution)

### Multiple Identifier Systems

**Issue:** SDP documentation uses multiple identifier formats that can be confusing:

| Format | Example | Usage | Status |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| `PP-FFF-SS` | `00-001-01` | Canonical workstream ID | ✅ Preferred |
| `WS-PP-FFF-SS` | `WS-001-01` | Legacy format | ⚠️ Deprecated |
| `PP-FFF-SS` | `01-001-01` | Short workstream ID | ✅ Acceptable |
| `beads-sdp-XXX` | `beads-sdp-118` | Legacy feature/workstream | ⚠️ Deprecated |
| `F-FFF` | `F24` | Short feature ID | ✅ Acceptable |
| `PP-FFF` | `01-001` | Feature ID | ✅ Preferred |
| `EP-XX` | `EP08` | Epic (legacy) | ❌ Replaced by Feature |

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. **Workstreams:** Always use `PP-FFF-SS` format in new docs
2. **Features:** Use `PP-FFF` format
3. **Releases:** Use `R1`, `R2` format
4. **Ideas:** Use `idea-{slug}` format
5. **Migration:** Gradually update legacy references

## Development Workflow

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)

**Definition:** Development methodology where tests are written before implementation.

**Cycle:** Red → Green → Refactor

**Steps:**
1. **Red:** Write failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **Green:** Write minimum code to make test pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve code design while tests pass

**Benefits:**
- Tests document expected behavior
- Confident refactoring
- 100% coverage by design
- Better API design

**Anti-pattern:** Writing tests after implementation

```python
# Step 1: RED - Write failing test
def test_user_can_be_created():
    user = User(email="test@example.com", name="Test")
    assert user.email == "test@example.com"
# Result: NameError: name 'User' is not defined

# Step 2: GREEN - Minimal implementation
@dataclass
class User:
    email: str
    name: str
# Result: Test passes

# Step 3: REFACTOR - Add validation
@dataclass
class User:
    email: str
    name: str
    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        if "@" not in self.email:
            raise ValueError("Invalid email")
# Result: Tests still pass, code improved
```

**Enforcement:** `/tdd` skill called by `@build`

**See Also:/tdd, @build, Test Coverage

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture

**Definition:** Layered architecture where dependencies point inward toward the domain.

**Layers (outside → inside):**
1. **Presentation** - UI layer (CLI, API, controllers)
2. **Infrastructure** - External concerns (DB, API, frameworks)
3. **Application** - Use cases (orchestration, services)
4. **Domain** - Business logic (entities, value objects)

**Dependency Rule:** Dependencies point INWARD

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Presentation                        │
│              (Controllers, Views, API)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                  Infrastructure                      │
│          (Database, External APIs, Frameworks)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   Application                        │
│              (Use Cases, Services)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                     Domain                           │
│           (Entities, Business Rules)                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

        ↑ Dependencies point INWARD (toward Domain)
```

**Layer Rules:**

| Layer | Can Import From | Cannot Import From |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Domain | Nothing | Application, Infrastructure, Presentation |
| Application | Domain | Infrastructure, Presentation |
| Infrastructure | Domain, Application | Presentation |
| Presentation | Application | - |

**Violation Example:**
```python
# ❌ Layer violation - Domain importing Infrastructure
from src.infrastructure.persistence import Database

class UserEntity:
    def save(self):
        db = Database()  # Domain shouldn't know about DB
```

**Correct Example:**
```python
# ✅ Clean separation
class UserEntity:
    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
```

**See Also:** Dependency Inversion, Layer Violation, SOLID

---

### Layer Violation

**Definition:** When code in an inner layer imports from an outer layer.

**Detection:**
```bash
grep -r "from.*infrastructure" src/domain/
```

**Examples:**
- Domain entity importing Database class
- Application service importing FastAPI
- Repository imported into Domain layer

**Consequence:** Violates dependency inversion, creates tight coupling

**Fix:** Use Protocol-based abstractions (ports)

**See Also:** Clean Architecture, Dependency Inversion, Protocol

---

### Dependency Inversion

**Definition:** SOLID principle stating that high-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concretions.

**Purpose:** Enable decoupling and testability.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Direct dependency on concrete class
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = MySQLDatabase()  # Tightly coupled

# ✅ GOOD: Depend on abstraction
class OrderRepository(Protocol):
    def save(self, order: Order) -> None: ...

class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, repository: OrderRepository):  # Abstract
        self.repository = repository
```

**See Also:** SOLID, Clean Architecture, Protocol

---

### Protocol

**Definition:** Python structural typing interface defining behavior without inheritance.

**Purpose:** Define abstractions for dependency injection.

**Example:**
```python
class SubmissionRepository(Protocol):
    def get_by_id(self, submission_id: str) -> Submission | None:

        match executor_type:
            case ExecutorType.DIND:
                return DindExecutor(self._config.dind, self._logger)
            case ExecutorType.K8S:
                return K8sExecutor(self._config.k8s, self._logger)

## Principles

### SOLID

**Definition:** Five principles of object-oriented design for maintainable software.

**Acronym:**
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Purpose:** Create maintainable, scalable software.

**See Also:** [docs/PRINCIPLES.md](docs/PRINCIPLES.md), Clean Architecture

---

### SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

**Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Multiple responsibilities
class UserService:
    def authenticate(self, email: str, password: str) -> User: ...
    def send_welcome_email(self, user: User) -> None: ...
    def generate_report(self, user: User) -> str: ...

# ✅ GOOD: Separated concerns
class AuthService:
    def authenticate(self, email: str, password: str) -> User: ...

class EmailService:
    def send_welcome(self, user: User) -> None: ...

class ReportGenerator:
    def generate_user_report(self, user: User) -> str: ...
```

**See Also:** SOLID, OCP

---

### OCP (Open/Closed Principle)

**Definition:** Open for extension, closed for modification.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Modifying existing code for new types
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process(self, payment_type: str, amount: float) -> None:
        if payment_type == "credit_card":
            self._process_credit_card(amount)
        elif payment_type == "paypal":
            self._process_paypal(amount)
        elif payment_type == "crypto":  # Adding new type = modifying class
            self._process_crypto(amount)

# ✅ GOOD: Extending via new classes
class PaymentProcessor(Protocol):
    def process(self, amount: float) -> None: ...

class CryptoProcessor:  # New type = new class, no modification
    def process(self, amount: float) -> None: ...
```

**See Also:** SOLID, Strategy Pattern

---

### LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

**Definition:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Subtype breaks parent contract
class Square(Rectangle):
    def set_width(self, width: int) -> None:
        self.width = width
        self.height = width  # Unexpected side effect

# ✅ GOOD: Proper abstraction
class Shape(Protocol):
    def area(self) -> float: ...
```

**See Also:** SOLID, Protocol

---

### ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)

**Definition:** Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Fat interface
class IWorker(Protocol):
    def work(self) -> None: ...
    def eat(self) -> None: ...

class Robot:  # Robots don't eat!
    def eat(self) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError  # Violation!

# ✅ GOOD: Segregated interfaces
class IWorkable(Protocol):
    def work(self) -> None: ...

class Robot:
    def work(self) -> None: ...  # Only implements what it needs
```

**See Also:** SOLID, Protocol

---

### DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

**Definition:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Direct dependency on concrete class
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = MySQLDatabase()  # Tightly coupled

# ✅ GOOD: Depend on abstraction
class OrderRepository(Protocol):
    def save(self, order: Order) -> None: ...

class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, repository: OrderRepository):  # Abstract
        self.repository = repository
```

**See Also:** SOLID, Protocol, Clean Architecture

---

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Definition:** Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Repeated validation
def create_user(email: str) -> User:
    if "@" not in email or "." not in email:
        raise InvalidEmailError(email)

def update_email(user: User, email: str) -> None:
    if "@" not in email or "." not in email:  # Duplicated!
        raise InvalidEmailError(email)

# ✅ GOOD: Single source of truth
class Email:
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        if not self._is_valid(value):
            raise InvalidEmailError(value)
        self.value = value

    @staticmethod
    def _is_valid(value: str) -> bool:
        return "@" in value and "." in value
```

**See Also:** KISS, YAGNI

---

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

**Definition:** The simplest solution is usually the best.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Over-engineered
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    import re
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s).lower()
    stack = []
    for char in cleaned:
        stack.append(char)
    reversed_str = ''
    while stack:
        reversed_str += stack.pop()
    return cleaned == reversed_str

# ✅ GOOD: Simple and clear
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    cleaned = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())
    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]
```

**See Also:** DRY, YAGNI

---

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

**Definition:** Don't build features until they're actually needed.

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ BAD: Building for hypothetical future
class Config:
    def __init__(
        self,
        database_url: str,
        cache_url: str | None = None,  # "Might need cache later"
        message_queue_url: str | None = None,  # "Might need queue later"
    ):
        ...

# ✅ GOOD: Build only what's needed NOW
class Config:
    def __init__(self, database_url: str):
        self.database_url = database_url

# Add cache_url when you actually need caching
```

**Guardrails:**
- Implement requirements **only**
- No "nice to have" features
- No "we might need this later"
- Delete unused code immediately

**See Also:** KISS, DRY

### Epic (Legacy)

**Definition:** **DEPRECATED** - Replaced by Feature in modern SDP.

**Status:** Use `PP-FFF` (Feature) instead of `EP-XX` (Epic)

**Migration:** `EP08` → `00-008` or similar

**See Also:** Feature, Release, Naming Conflicts

### Sprint (Legacy)

**Definition:** **DEPRECATED** - SDP does not use time-based iterations.

**Reasoning:** SDP uses scope-based estimation (LOC/tokens), not time.

**Replacement:** Workstream (scope-based)

**See Also:** Workstream, YAGNI

### Progressive Disclosure

**Definition:** UX pattern where information is revealed incrementally.

**Usage:** `@feature` skill uses progressive disclosure to:
1. Start with high-level vision
2. Reveal details as needed
3. Avoid overwhelming users

**See Also:** @feature, UX

### AskUserQuestion

**Definition:** Tool for deep interviewing in Claude Code skills.

**Purpose:** Ask non-obvious questions exploring tradeoffs.

**Used By:** `@idea`, `@design`

**Characteristics:**
- No yes/no questions
- Explores technical approaches
- Uncovers concerns
- Validates assumptions

**See Also:** @idea, @design, Skill

### EnterPlanMode

**Definition:** State in which codebase exploration is allowed.

**Used By:** `@design` skill

**Purpose:** Enable agents to read files and explore codebase before planning.

**Flow:**
1. `@design` invoked
2. EnterPlanMode (codebase exploration allowed)
3. Explore codebase
4. AskUserQuestion for architecture decisions
5. ExitPlanMode (require approval)

**See Also:** @design, ExitPlanMode, AskUserQuestion

---

### ExitPlanMode

**Definition:** State transition requesting approval for proposed plan.

**Used By:** `@design` skill

**Purpose:** Require human approval before proceeding with implementation.

**Flow:**
1. Plan created
2. ExitPlanMode (request approval)
3. Human approves
4. Plan accepted, workstreams created

**See Also:** @design, EnterPlanMode, Approval

### TodoWrite

**Definition:** Claude Code tool for real-time progress tracking.

**Used By:** `@build` skill

**Purpose:** Show real-time progress during workstream execution.

**Example:**
```
✓ [completed] Pre-build validation
✓ [in_progress] Write failing test (Red)
• [pending] Implement minimum code (Green)
```

**See Also:** @build, Progress Tracking
