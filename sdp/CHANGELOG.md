# Changelog

All notable changes to the Spec-Driven Protocol (SDP).

## [0.9.8] - 2026-02-26

### Skills Sync, Beads Integration

- **@build** — Post-build `bd close` for beads in WS frontmatter; batch syntax `/build 00-XXX-YY..ZZ`
- **@design** — Pre-draft check, bead verification, default-in-scope
- **@review** — Handoff block when CHANGES_REQUESTED
- **CLAUDE.md** — Sync with sdp_dev/AGENTS.md (placement, "продолжай" convention)

### Evidence + Checkpoint Commit, Guard Strict

- **@build** — Step 3b: commit evidence + checkpoint after `sdp-orchestrate --advance`
- **.gitignore** — `!.sdp/evidence/`, `!.sdp/checkpoints/` (evidence must be committed with PR)
- **sdp guard** — `deactivate` without `|| true`; `activate` in pre-build without `|| true` (blocking)
- **go-ci** — `sdp contract validate` without `|| true` (blocking)

### Installer

- **install.sh** — Fail when no sha256 tool (security); do not skip checksum verification
- **install-project.sh** — Clear retry command on CLI install failure
- **README, QUICKSTART** — Document binary-only vs full project install modes

### Release, Init

- **Release workflow** — In sdp repo: protocol-e2e with GLM_API_KEY, then sdp CLI release
- **sdp init** — Executable-relative paths for global install; `--auto` in protocol-e2e Phase 2b
- **Phase 5** — Fail when GLM_API_KEY not set (opencode LLM required)

### Git Hooks (pre-commit, pre-push)

- **pre-commit** — `go build ./...`; ws-verdict schema validation when `docs/ws-verdicts/*.json` changed
- **pre-push** — `go test -short ./...`; evidence validation for feature branches when `internal/` or `cmd/` changed
- **install-git-hooks.sh** — Symlinks `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, `.git/hooks/pre-push` to `scripts/hooks/`
- **Docs** — AGENTS.md, runbook for sdp_dev (Go project, evidence, ws-verdict)

---

### Coverage Context + Protocol-Only Docs Boundary

**New:**
- **CheckCoverage(ctx)** — Coverage checker accepts `context.Context` for cancellation support.
- **Intent schema docs** — `docs/intent/README.md` documents intent specification format.
- **Schema path consistency** — Schemas served from `schema/` at SDP root.
- **ws-verdict, review-verdict** — JSON schemas for build and review outputs.

**Protocol boundary:**
- Removed non-protocol docs (workstreams, roadmap, plans, reviews, decisions, specs) — migrated to sdp_dev.
- Kept minimal `docs/reference/` (PRINCIPLES, GLOSSARY, build/design/review specs).
- Added `docs/README.md` index for protocol documentation.

**Fixes:**
- **intent.schema.json** — Restored valid JSON (was corrupted).
- **Windows build** — Added `lock_windows.go` (no-op flock); evidence layer requires UNIX.
- **Lint** — gofmt, prealloc, gocognit, errcheck nolints.
- **TestVerifyCmd** — Replaced hanging integration test with `TestVerifyCmdConstructed` unit test.

**Audit remediation:**
- Verifier interface abstraction (CoverageChecker, PathValidator, CommandRunner).
- Parser frontmatter fix (Index for both `---` delimiters).
- Configurable coverage timeouts, EmitSync docstrings, Writer hash-chain atomicity.
- Guard rules path validation, ParseDependencies safe fallback, ctx propagation.

**Install:**
- `SDP_REF=v0.9.8` for testing. OpenCode: `SDP_IDE=opencode` or `SDP_IDE=all`.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-02-24

### Phase 0 + protocol E2E: Skills, Schema, Constraints, Full Protocol

**New:**
- **Coding Workflow Predicate (in-toto v1)** — `schema/coding-workflow-predicate.schema.json` for attestations. Predicate type: `https://sdp.dev/attestation/coding-workflow/v1`. See [docs/attestation/coding-workflow-v1.md](docs/attestation/coding-workflow-v1.md).
- **@feature --auto** — Generate workstreams directly from roadmap. Skip full discovery for features already in ROADMAP.md.
- **@design** — Workstream file format with Scope Files, beads mapping, INDEX.md update. Required sections documented.
- **PreToolUse constraint enforcement** — `sdp-guard --check-constraints` integration. Reads `.sdp/agent-constraints.yaml` for phase-specific rules (scope, force-push, destructive git).

**Phase 0:**
- Removed phantom guard CLI refs (context, branch, complete, finding)
- Slim @oneshot skill; outer loop via sdp-orchestrate
- Language-agnostic skills: quality gates per AGENTS.md, `master` not `dev`
- @build scope fix; stripped evidence boilerplate
- Deleted `help.md`, `init.md`; compressed deploy, review, implementer

**Install:**
- `SDP_REF` env var for branch/ref (e.g. `SDP_REF=v0.9.7` for testing)
- OpenCode/Windsurf: `SDP_IDE=opencode` or `SDP_IDE=all`

---

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-16

### Patch Release
