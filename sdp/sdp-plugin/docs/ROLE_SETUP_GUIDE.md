## What Are Roles?

In SDP, **roles** define specialized agent personas that handle specific aspects of feature development.

**Why use roles?**

- **Specialization:** Each role focuses on one area (testing, security, UX)
- **Parallelization:** Multiple roles work simultaneously
- **Expertise:** Roles have deep knowledge in their domain
- **Consistency:** Same role = same approach across features

**Example:**
```
Feature: "Add payments"
├── Security Role (OWASP checks)
├── Testing Role (E2E tests)
├── UX Role (User flows)
└── Performance Role (Load testing)
```

---

## Role Architecture

### Role Structure

Each role has:

```yaml
name: security-reviewer
version: "1.0"
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities

# System prompt
prompt: |
  You are a security expert. Review code for:
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - XSS attack vectors
  - Authentication flaws
  - ...

# Activation conditions
when:
  - workstream_complete
  - feature_review

# Actions
actions:
  - review_code
  - suggest_fixes
  - log_findings

# Deliverables
outputs:
  - security_report.md
  - remediation_plan.md
```

### Role Lifecycle

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  DEFINE  │───→│  CREATE  │───→│ ACTIVATE │───→│  REVIEW  │
│   Role   │    │   File   │    │   Role   │    │  Output  │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
```

## Creating Roles

### Step 1: Define Role Purpose

Ask yourself:
- What problem does this role solve?
- What expertise does it need?
- When should it activate?
- What should it output?

**Example:**
```
Role: Performance Analyst
Problem: Features often have performance bottlenecks
Expertise: Load testing, profiling, optimization
When: After workstream complete, before deploy
Output: Performance report, optimization recommendations
```

### Step 2: Create Role File

**Location:** `.claude/roles/{role-name}.md`

**Template:**

```markdown
---
name: performance-analyst
version: "1.0"
description: Analyzes performance and suggests optimizations
expertise_level: "senior"
activation:
  - workstream_complete
  - feature_review
required_context:
  - feature_id
  - workstream_id
outputs:
  - performance_report.md
---

# Performance Analyst Role

You are a performance optimization expert with 10+ years of experience.

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Analyze** code for performance bottlenecks
2. **Benchmark** critical paths
3. **Profile** memory usage
4. **Suggest** optimizations
5. **Validate** improvements

## Activation Triggers

You activate when:
- A workstream is complete (before moving to next)
- Feature is ready for review
- Performance concerns are raised

## Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Database query performance (N+1 queries)
- [ ] Memory leaks (unbounded growth)
- [ ] CPU bottlenecks (hot paths)
- [ ] Network latency (unnecessary calls)
- [ ] Caching opportunities
- [ ] Algorithmic complexity

## Output Format

### Performance Report

```markdown
# Performance Report: WS-001

## Summary
- Overall: ✅ PASS
- Critical Issues: 0
- Recommendations: 2

## Findings

### 1. Database Query Performance
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** N+1 query problem in User.List()
**Impact:** 100ms → 2000ms for 100 users
**Fix:** Use preloading/eager loading

### 2. Memory Usage
**Severity:** Low
**Issue:** Unbounded slice growth
**Impact:** Memory increases 10MB/minute
**Fix:** Pre-allocate slice capacity

## Benchmarks

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| User.List | 2000ms | 150ms | 93% |
| User.Get  | 50ms   | 45ms  | 10% |

## Recommendations

1. Implement query batching for User.List
2. Add memory pool for frequently allocated structs
```

## Tools You Use

- `go test -bench` (Go benchmarks)
- `pprof` (CPU/memory profiling)
- `ab`/`wrk` (load testing)
- Custom benchmark scripts

## Collaboration

- Work with developers on optimization strategies
- Coordinate with QA on performance test plans
- Report to architect on systemic issues
```

### Step 3: Register Role

**Method 1: Manual Registration**

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "roles": [
    ".claude/roles/performance-analyst.md",
    ".claude/roles/security-reviewer.md",
    ".claude/roles/ux-designer.md"
  ]
}
```

**Method 2: Beads Integration**

```bash
# Register role with Beads
bd create role \
  --name="performance-analyst" \
  --path=".claude/roles/performance-analyst.md" \
  --description="Analyzes performance and suggests optimizations"
```

### Step 4: Test Role

```bash
# Activate role manually
@role performance-analyst

# Test activation
@role performance-analyst "Review WS-001 for performance issues"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
🎭 Role: performance-analyst
📊 Analyzing: WS-001 (Domain Models)
✅ Analysis complete

Findings:
- 2 medium issues
- 1 low issue

Report: .oneshot/performance-report-ws-001.md
```

## Role Coordination

### Parallel Execution

Multiple roles can work simultaneously:

```bash
# Activate multiple roles for feature review
@roles security-reviewer,performance-analyst,ux-designer "Review F001"
```

**Output:**

```
🎭 Activating 3 roles...

[security-reviewer] Analyzing F001...
[performance-analyst] Profiling F001...
[ux-designer] Reviewing F001 UX...

[security-reviewer] ✅ Complete (2 issues found)
[performance-analyst] ✅ Complete (3 recommendations)
[ux-designer] ✅ Complete (5 suggestions)

📊 Combined report: .oneshot/f001-review-combined.md
```

### Sequential Execution

Roles activate in sequence:

```yaml
activation:
  - security-reviewer: after_workstream
  - test-architect: after_security_review
  - code-reviewer: after_tests
  - devops-engineer: before_deploy
```

### Role Communication

Roles can coordinate via messages:

```
[security-reviewer] → [test-architect]
"Add test for SQL injection in login flow"

[test-architect] → [security-reviewer]
"Test added: TestLogin_SQLInjection"
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Roles Focused

❌ **Bad:** One role does everything
```yaml
name: full-stack-developer
responsibilities: [security, testing, ux, performance, devops, ...]
```

✅ **Good:** Specialized roles
```yaml
name: security-reviewer
responsibilities: [security_analysis]
```

### 2. Define Clear Activation Triggers

❌ **Bad:** Activates randomly
```yaml
activation:
  - sometimes
```

✅ **Good:** Specific events
```yaml
activation:
  - workstream_complete
  - pre_deploy
```

### 3. Require Context

❌ **Bad:** No context required
```yaml
required_context: []
```

✅ **Good:** Explicit context
```yaml
required_context:
  - feature_id
  - workstream_id
  - code_location
```

### 4. Provide Actionable Output

❌ **Bad:** Vague feedback
```markdown
## Issues Found
Some issues exist. Fix them.
```

✅ **Good:** Specific, actionable
```markdown
## Issues Found

### High: SQL Injection
**Location:** `auth.go:145`
**Line:** `query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", userID)`
**Fix:** Use parameterized query
```go
query := "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
rows, err := db.Query(query, userID)
```
```

### 5. Test Roles Thoroughly

Before using in production:

```bash
# Test role activation
@role security-reviewer "Review WS-001"

# Verify output
cat .oneshot/security-report-ws-001.md

# Check quality
- Is report actionable?
- Are issues clear?
- Are fixes specific?
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Role not activating

**Solution:** Check activation triggers

```bash
# Verify role is registered
cat .claude/settings.json | grep roles

# Check activation conditions
cat .claude/roles/security-reviewer.md | grep -A 5 activation
```

### Issue: Role output not actionable

**Solution:** Improve role prompt

Add specific examples:
```markdown
## Example Output

### Bad
"Fix the security issue"

### Good
"File: auth.go:145
Issue: SQL injection vulnerability
Fix: Replace string concatenation with parameterized query"
```

### Issue: Role too slow

**Solution:** Optimize role responsibilities

- Split into multiple focused roles
- Reduce scope (only critical issues)
- Add timeouts to role activation
